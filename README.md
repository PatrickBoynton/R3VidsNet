# R3VidsNet

## Instructions

Add a wwwroot folder to the root of the project, and add some videos to the wwwroot folder.
Run docker-compose up to start the project.
If you're looking at the code in an IDE like Rider, or VisualStudio, you may encounter errors.
If you do, simply rebuild the project from the IDE, and errors should go away.
Everything should be up and running, without IDE errors.
If you do not have a VideoNavigation table in your database you'll need to add it, as the front end requires one.
This should be done automatically, but if not, then you can use any of the regular ways of adding it.
When you add a video, you'll need to restart the project. Currently, there is no way to add it automatically.
In order to add a model you'll need to rebuild the project from the IDE as well. Also do not forget to add the model to
the context.
I will add exact commands later if needed.
